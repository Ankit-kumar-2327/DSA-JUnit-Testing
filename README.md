# Unit Testing Framework for Data Structures (DSA – JUnit Testing)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java with a strong focus on **unit testing using JUnit**.  
The goal is to ensure correctness, robustness, and reliability of operations through automated test cases and continuous integration.

---

## 🛠️ Features
-  Java implementations of **Stack, Queue, Linked List, and Binary Search**  
-  **JUnit test cases** covering standard and edge cases  
-  Validation for scenarios like **overflow, underflow, null inputs, and invalid indices**  
-  Achieved **90%+ test coverage**  
-  Integrated with **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD

-  📊 Sample Test Cases

StackTest: push, pop, peek, overflow, underflow

QueueTest: enqueue, dequeue, circular queue edge cases

LinkedListTest: insert, delete, search, null handling

BinarySearchTest: valid searches, invalid inputs, boundary checks
